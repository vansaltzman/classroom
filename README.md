## Usage

Users must have an account made for them by their organization to login to the platform. Once logged on, the available features will depend on if they are designated as a Student or as a Teacher.

Teachers can:
- Create Classes & Add students to a class
- Create quiz questions
- Construct quizzes from existing or new questions (seeing data about how that question has performed in the past)
- View a dasboard with student's grades and participation in a class
- Launch a class to go live where they can:
  - See which students are present
  - Launch a "thumb poll" to get quick student feedback on a good-ok-bad type question
  - Launch a quiz seeing in real-time studnent's current question, current grade and completinon status in an easy to read dasobhard
- End a class persisting live data to the main database

Students can
- View their classes seeing which ones are live
- See past performance in classes that are not live
- Enter a live class in session where they will be shown:
  - live polls, quizzes, etc.
- "Raise their hand" in a class that will alert the teacher
- NOT change their view in a class - this is all controlled by the teacher
